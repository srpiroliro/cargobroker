# CargoBroker

Welcome to CargoBroker, a Rust-based trading engine designed to simulate the functionality of a financial trading platform.

## Project Overview

CargoBroker is an exploratory project with the aim of delving into the capabilities of Rust programming. The core objective is to build a trading system that handles various types of orders with efficiency and reliability. 

## Features

- **Market Orders:** Execute trades immediately at the current market price.
- **Limit Orders:** Set trades to execute only at a specified price or better.
- **Order Matching:** A system that pairs buy and sell orders based on price and time priority.
- **Graphical User Interface (GUI):** An intuitive interface for users to interact with the trading system and manage orders.

## Goals

The primary goal of CargoBroker is to serve as a learning conduit for Rust programming, focusing on the following areas:

- Utilizing Rust's performance capabilities to handle real-time order processing.
- Implementing Rust's concurrency features to manage multiple trades efficiently.
- Designing a user-friendly GUI to place and track orders.

## Getting Started

To get started with CargoBroker:

1. Ensure you have Rust installed on your system. Visit the official Rust website for installation instructions.
2. Clone the repository to your local machine.
3. Build the project using Cargo, Rust's built-in package manager and build system.
4. Run the application and begin trading simulation.

## Contribution

As a learning project, contributions are highly encouraged. Whether it's adding new features, improving the GUI, or fixing bugs, your input is welcome. Please feel free to fork the repository and submit pull requests.
